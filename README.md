# jwhite42.com

Personal website I have developed using Django. Current released version is entirely static, pure HTML & CSS, for hosting purposes.

## Current V3:
Redesigned from previous version to make it look more professional (and I didn't really like it). Design inpsired by [Brittany Chiang](https://brittanychiang.com).

Built entirely by myself using my own code with HTML and CSS. This site is completely static as I planned so it can be deployed on Amazon S3 using Static Website Hosting.

## Hosting:
The site is hosted statically in AWS using Simple Storage Service (S3), CloudFront and Route 53.

## Mobile Device Issues
Unfortunatley the site does not work well on mobile devices but I am in the process of rectifying that. I am a self taught developer and am still learning bits and bobs as I go but this is at the top of my list once I get around to it.
