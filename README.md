Personal website I have developed using pure HTML & CSS. Have started redeveloping using Django & React.

## Current V3:
Redesigned from previous version to make it look more professional (and I didn't really like it). Design inpsired by [Brittany Chiang](https://brittanychiang.com).

Built entirely by myself using my own code with HTML and CSS. This site is completely static as I planned so it can be deployed on Amazon S3 using Static Website Hosting.
