# Personal Website

Personal website I have developed - [jwhite42.com](http://jwhite42.com)

**Warning:** Unfortunatley the site does not work well on mobile devices and am in the process of rectifying that.

## Hosting:
The site is hosted statically in AWS using Simple Storage Service (S3) and CloudFront.

## Website V1:
Developed from scratch in the Django Web Framework with a working backend. This site has been replaced by an improved verision (V2) which focused more on making the site static and involved a complete redesign.

## Website V2:
Redesign of the orginal website and was built from scratch mostly to gain more practice with HTML and CSS. This site is completely static as I planned to deploy the site on Amazon S3 using Static Website Hosting.
